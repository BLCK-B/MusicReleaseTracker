Look at music releases from individual artists and see all songs ordered by date in "Combined view".
You will no longer have to search social media or streaming services in fear of missing a new song. MusicReleaseTracker is a free, open-source, no-nonsense program for music discovery.

Currently available sources: Beatport, Musicbrainz, Junodownload.

Setup
-

**dependencies:** A web browser. UI is rendered there.

**Windows:** Download and install. When launched, Spring terminal and browser window/tab will open.

**Linux:** Not set up yet.

---
**In MRT:** Add artists you want to track and for each artist optionally insert links according to instructions.
With links inserted, click refresh button to initiate the scraping process.

**Responsibility**: Delays during scraping prevent excessive traffic.
To avoid granting admin permission, unzip the installer. You can run the exe, but ensure a folder *MusicReleaseTracker* exists in appdata. 
I have no affiliation with Musicbrainz, Beatport, Junodownload. I can only recommend contributing to [crowdsourced](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute) projects and directly supporting artists via Bandcamp and other means.
