You will no longer have to search on social media or streaming services for new songs. You can choose exactly which
sources to use,
and which artists to track. Latest information is compiled into one simple overview.
This is achieved through custom processing.

For the latest information, press the refresh button. Combining more sources means that you are less likely to miss
anything. Best of all, you don’t need any accounts - MRT runs locally on your computer.

Currently available sources: `Beatport`, `Musicbrainz` and `Youtube`.
