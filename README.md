You will no longer have to search social media or streaming services. Never miss a new song or album again. You can choose exactly which sources to use, and which artists to track. Latest information is compiled into a simple overview. This is achieved through custom processing.

For the latest information, press the refresh button. Combining more sources means that you are less likely to miss anything. Best of all, you donâ€™t need any accounts - MRT runs locally on your computer.

Currently available sources: `Beatport`, `Musicbrainz` and `Youtube`.
