Latest information is compiled into a simple overview. This is achieved through advanced processing.

You will no longer have to search social media or streaming services. Never miss a new song again.

Currently available sources: Beatport, Musicbrainz, Junodownload, Youtube.

Setup
-

**dependencies:** A web browser: UI is rendered there. Works best with firefox. Linux: OpenJDK.

**Windows:** Download and install. When launched, Spring terminal and browser window/tab will open.

**Linux:** Run jar by ```java -jar XXX.jar```

**macOS:** *Should be same as Linux. Not tested. Can someone confirm?

---

**Responsibility**:

Delays during scraping prevent excessive traffic.

I have no affiliation with Musicbrainz, Beatport, Junodownload or Youtube.
