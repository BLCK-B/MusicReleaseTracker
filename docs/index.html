    <h2>Stay on top</h2>
    <p>
      I needed a better way to keep track of new music from my favourite artists. Streaming services and their recommendation algorithms often miss things. Thankfully, there are websites that have just the information I need. I built this tool to collect the information from these sources. Custom processing - the magic behind the scenes - creates a simple overview of the latest singles and albums. Currently supported sources are <strong>Beatport</strong>, <strong>Musicbrainz</strong> and <strong>Youtube</strong>.
    </p>
	<p>
      You can choose exactly which sources to use, and which artists you want to track. When you want the latest information, just press the refresh button and MusicReleaseTracker will do the job for you. Combining more sources means that you are less likely to miss anything. Sometimes, it can see into the future! Best of all, you don’t need any accounts to use it.
